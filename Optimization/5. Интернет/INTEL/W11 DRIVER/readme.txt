See the release notes for the list of all currently known issues,
limitations, and resolved issues.


Supported Operating Systems
===========================

The drivers in this software release have been tested with the
operating systems (OSs) listed below. Additional OSs may function with
our drivers but are not tested.

Note:

  Not all devices support all operating systems listed. Refer to the
  Release Notes for detailed OS support information for your device.


Microsoft Windows Server*, Azure Stack HCI, and Windows*
--------------------------------------------------------

* Microsoft Windows Server* 2025

* Microsoft Windows Server 2022

* Microsoft Windows Server 2019, Version 1903

* Microsoft Windows Server 2016

* Microsoft Azure Stack HCI

* Microsoft Windows* 11 version 24H2

* Microsoft Windows 11 version 23H2 (build 22631.2506)

* Microsoft Windows 11 version 22H2 (build 22621)

* Microsoft Windows 10 version 21H2 (build 19044)

* Microsoft Windows 10 RS5, Version 1809 (build 17763)

Note:

  * Devices based on the following do not support Microsoft Windows or
    Windows Server:

    * Intel® Ethernet Connection E822-C

    * Intel® Ethernet Connection E822-L

  * Microsoft Windows 32-bit operating systems are only supported on
    Intel 1Gbps Ethernet Adapters.

  * Some older Intel Ethernet adapters do not have full software
    support for the most recent versions of Microsoft Windows. Many
    older Intel Ethernet adapters have base drivers supplied by
    Microsoft Windows.

  * In Microsoft Windows Server 2025, all devices based on the Intel
    Ethernet 710 Series are reported with generic, 2-part device IDs
    and branding strings, and will be configured as generic devices
    with no custom default settings. This change resolves an issue
    seen when deploying network intent roles using the Network ATC
    scripts in Windows Server 2025 and Azure Stack HCI.

Intel Fiber Optic Connections
=============================

Caution: The fiber optic ports may utilize Class 1 or Class 1M laser
devices. Do not stare into the end of a fiber optic connector
connected to a "live" system. Do not use optical instruments to view
the laser output. Using optical instruments increases eye hazard.
Laser radiation is hazardous and may cause eye injury. To inspect a
connector, receptacle or adapter end, be sure that the fiber optic
device or system is turned off, or the fiber cable is disconnected
from the "live" system.

The Intel Gigabit and 10GbE network adapters with fiber optic
connections operate only at their native speed and only at full-
duplex. Therefore you do not need to make any adjustments. Use of
controls or adjustments or performance of procedures other than those
specified herein may result in hazardous radiation exposure. The laser
module contains no serviceable parts.
